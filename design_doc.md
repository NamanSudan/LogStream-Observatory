  - Infinite loop that generates a new log every second.
  - Uses the `random` module to select log levels and sources randomly.
- **Sending Logs**:
  - Uses Python's `socket` library to send logs over TCP to Vector.dev, or `requests` library to send over HTTP.
  - Logs are formatted as JSON strings.

### 2. Vector.dev Configuration

#### 2.1. Input Configuration

- **Source**:
  - **Type**: `socket` (for TCP) or `http` (for HTTP).
  - **Configuration**:
    - **Address**: Listens on a specified port (e.g., `9000` for TCP).

#### 2.2. Transforms (Optional)

- **Functionality**:
  - Perform any necessary transformations on the logs, such as parsing or adding metadata.

#### 2.3. Output Configuration

- **Sink**:
  - **Type**: `clickhouse` sink.
  - **Configuration**:
    - **Endpoint**: URL of the ClickHouse server.
    - **Database**: `logs`.
    - **Table**: `application_logs`.
    - **Credentials**: If authentication is required.

#### 2.4. Configuration File Example (`vector.toml`)

```toml
[sources.logs_in]
  type = "socket"
  address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
  mode = "tcp"

[transforms.parse_json]
  type = "json_parser"
  inputs = ["logs_in"]
  drop_invalid = true

[sinks.clickhouse]
  type = "clickhouse"
  inputs = ["parse_json"]
  endpoint = "http://clickhouse-server:8123"
  database = "logs"
  table = "application_logs"
  skip_unknown_fields = true
```

### 3. ClickHouse Schema Design

#### 3.1. Database and Table

- **Database**: `logs`
- **Table**: `application_logs`

#### 3.2. Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs.application_logs (
    timestamp DateTime,
    log_level String,
    message String,
    source String
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

- **Columns**:
  - `timestamp`: The time the log was generated.
  - `log_level`: Severity level of the log.
  - `message`: The log message content.
  - `source`: The originating source/module of the log.

#### 3.3. Engine and Ordering

- **Engine**: `MergeTree`
  - Suitable for large datasets and allows for fast querying.
- **ORDER BY**: `timestamp`
  - Optimizes queries that filter or sort by time.

### 4. Flask Application Design

#### 4.1. Functionality

- Provides a web interface to display the logs stored in ClickHouse.
- Displays the most recent 100 logs in a tabular format.
- Potential for additional features:
  - Search by log level, source, or message content.
  - Pagination for log entries.

#### 4.2. Implementation Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database Connection**:
  - Uses the `clickhouse-driver` library to connect to ClickHouse.
  - Executes SQL queries to retrieve log data.

#### 4.3. Routes and Views

- **`/` (Index Route)**:
  - Queries the latest 100 logs.
  - Passes the log data to the template for rendering.

#### 4.4. Templates

- **`index.html`**:
  - Uses Jinja2 templating engine.
  - Renders a table with columns for Timestamp, Log Level, Source, and Message.
  - Applies basic styling for readability.

#### 4.5. Deployment Considerations
